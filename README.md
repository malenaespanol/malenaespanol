- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @malenaespanol
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing mathematical models and numerical methods to solve problems in science and engineering. In particular, I work on problems related
to computer vision, medical images, and materials science. 
- ðŸŒ± I mentor high school students, undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs. I love to form very diverse teams where everyone can learn from each 
other and reach their full potential while working on research projects that can make a societal impact.
